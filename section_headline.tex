\par{
A technology-agnostic software developer with a robust skill set encompassing languages like C\#, Python, Rust, and front-end frameworks such as Angular and React. I bring extensive expertise in software development and architecture. I've been instrumental in spearheading the transition towards asynchronous event-driven microservices, leveraging domain-driven design and clean architecture principles. Equipped with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from RMIT University and additional studies in IT Security \& Criminology from Deakin University, I combine academic rigor with hands-on experience to drive impactful software solutions.
