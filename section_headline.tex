A technology-agnostic software developer with a robust skill set encompassing languages like C\#, Python, Rust, and front-end frameworks such as Angular and React. I have extensive expertise in software development and the implementation of complex data structures and algorithms when necessary (a big advocate for code simplicity). I have been instrumental in designing towards clean code, consistency, and well thought-out solution architecture. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from RMIT University and additional studies in IT Security \& Criminology from Deakin University.
